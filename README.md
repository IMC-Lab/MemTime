# Times Imagined and Remembered

Data and code for results in a chapter forthcoming in Hoerl, C., McCormack, T., & Fernandes, A. (Eds.). *Temporal Asymmetries in Philosophy and Psychology.*

# How to use this repo
All data files are contained in [`data`](https://github.com/IMC-Lab/MemTime/tree/master/data). Raw data & ANOVA coding can be found in `anova.csv`, and data for the telescoping analysis can be found in `temporal_distance.csv`. The R script `memTime_diff.R` contains the code to run the latter analysis and plot the results.
